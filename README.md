# GeoReport Template

A simple template for experimenting with geographic reports: reports with embedded geographic information.  Uses [Jekyll Static Site Generator](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) to manage report content.  Maps are built with leaflet.js/mapbox.js.  **GeoReport** was built as an open source report editing platform for the CrowdCover [Moabi Project](http://rdc.moabi.org).  See [an example report](http://rdc.moabi.org/redd_risk/en/).

This is a fork of [jekyll-foundation](https://github.com/jameslaneconkling/jekyll-foundation), which is a simple merge of Jekyll's starter scaffold with [foundation-essentials-5.5.0](http://foundation.zurb.com/develop/download.html).
